**Overview of Price Range Analysis**

Objectives:                
1.Identify the Most Common Price Range: Determine which price range category is most frequently represented among the restaurants.             
2.Calculate Average Rating by Price Range: Compute the average rating for restaurants within each price range.              
3.Identify Color Representing Highest Average Rating: Determine the color associated with the price range that has the highest average rating.               

Key Activities:               
1.Identify Most Common Price Range:               
*Count the frequency of each price range category.                  
*Identify the price range with the highest count.              

2.Calculate Average Rating for Each Price Range:             
*Group the dataset by price range.               
*Calculate the mean rating for each price range group.            

3.Determine Color Representation:               
*Identify the color associated with each price range in the dataset.                
*Find the color that corresponds to the price range with the highest average rating.             

Technology Used:            
Programming Language:               
*Python: A versatile programming language widely used for data analysis and preprocessing.      

Libraries and Tools:          
*Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including handling missing values and data type conversions.           
*NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.            
*Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.           
*Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, particularly useful for exploring and understanding the distribution of variables.
